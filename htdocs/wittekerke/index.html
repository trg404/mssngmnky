 		         <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>’m rapidly approaching an age where people confuse me for young and hip and all I want is my hips to be young and not ache. I have noticed when visiting friends who work the bars and clubs where clothes are worn ironically and  a clientele that is given to knowing the obscurer parts of the region that there are two schools of hipsters out there. The ones who drink PBR and those who think it’s gone to “mainstream”. That is where Wittekerke comes into play. </p>

		        <p>With a taste a bit more flavorful than blue moon, and a creamy body that Shock Top wishes it had, Wittekerke is a very approachable beer. Imported from Belgium by the same people that brought over Petrus, Scotch Silly and other Belgian beers that if you don’t care about the difference between a dubbel and a quad you will never need to know about nor should care to. It could get lost in the throngs of import beers on the shelf except for the fact that it’s sold in bulk and so cheap that it’s a hipsters heaven. </p>

              <p>After riding your fixed gear bike to a band who's name is a random set of names generated by an offline geocities page that no one has heard of because it never  truly existed, you too can order a can of familiar tasting beer from a laconic bartender who nods recognition, even though it’s your first time here. Lost in an obscure beer that tastes like the beers you got at the supermarket yesterday you can now put on that aura of authority because you and your compatriots are now part of a secret club that only drinks obscure beers from Belgium that the general public has never heard of.</p>

              <p>With a growing popularity not just from the hipster elite, you can now find the six packs of stainless steel cans in supermarkets. I suggest picking one up, the five percent alcohol lends itself to being easy to indulge in and still get errands done if you wish. It’s a blessing to be able to now enjoy the same beer as the hipster elite without having to read proust novels and decide on which ironic nostalgic tattoo you want to get. </p>
