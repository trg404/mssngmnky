<h1>
Dale's Pale Ale
</h1>
</header>

<p>A beer with a lying problem <strong>Dale’s Pale Ale</strong> is a hop centric tour of what the western United States has to offer. The new brewery in Brevard North Carolina doesn’t really let you know that this is a Colorado born and bred recipe for shoving enough hops down the beers throat to make a beer drinker take second notice of this easy sipping IPA and rough as hell pale ale. Selling it to customers without a warning of this hop laden can of goodness is akin to not letting someone know that you’re cop while looking for a weed hook-up. It’s a damn good IPA and not to be missed but be warned you’re in for a shock if you’re expecting a pale ale.

Sitting on your match.com date things are going great with Diane. You order a beer and she orders a wine the intoxication turns into light petting at the restaurant. You know that you’re that couple but you don’t care. How often do you find a girl that loves the Denver Broncos as much as you, can quote all your favorite gangster movies, and knows the difference between a lug nut and a wing nut. Your food comes with a disgusted look from the waiter, you dig into your food and slip off your shoe to slowly go up her leg. She blushes mildly as you go higher and higher up her dress and then you feel them. You jerk back in shock thinking “did I just feel what i felt?” take a swig of beer and look at her deep in the eyes. She gives you a deep look back thinking back on the entire night you think. <i>“Well I could go this way who knows.”</i> and slip your foot back to playing with your new found date Dale.
