Out for spring break because the your city has exploded in an Irish car bomb of green and drunkard, you walk down the crowded streets remember a time when you were in Ireland and can’t remember seeing anything close to this rendition of Apocalypse now. You walk into a bar with a motivation of “can’t beat them join them” instead of ride of the valkyries you’re assaulted to Massachusetts  accented claims of how irish they are and bands claiming similar concepts. In a sea of horrible stereotypes and probably well beyond borderlined racist accusations the bartender asks for your order “Guinness Please.”
