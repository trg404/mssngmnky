                Coming out seasonally in the fall/winter*  months Fade to Black by Left Hand Brewery* could have just been another attempt at an annual Russian Imperial Stout, Cigar City has their Marshall Zhukov and Hunapu, 3 Floyd’s has about as much fan fare for their Dark Lord, both of which are good beers but not worth the fan fare. All three breweries take time to celebrate the seasons ending and beginning of another year. A time to look back and relax at what’s come and gone. I prefer the experimentation of doing something different and dark than to repeating the same recipe year after year.

Left Hand brewery has had five years of non-repeating volumes in the Fade to Black series, starting with a foreign stout with tasting notes of “self loathing, burnt opportunities and smoked relationships.” Their second volume was deeper yet: a Smoked Baltic Porter that would make Great Fire Chicagoans say, “Damn that’s smokey”. Left Hand spiced it up the next year with their Pepper Porter, which plays between self flagellation and agony. Their Rocky Mountain Black Ale takes the darkness to a new level. Keeping the hop head in mind, hops abound and are only balanced by the smoked malt. Fortunately, it fails in its balancing job in an amazingly awesome way. The most current volume from Left Hand is a Black Rye Ale. Departing from the over-abundance, I found this beer to be balanced and reassured that there was light at the end of the tunnel. I'm not sure whether it’s old age or just pessimism dying but I like the new turn.
