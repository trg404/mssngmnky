Sitting on the front porch as the sun sets* you think back to your early days,* your highschool days, your prom date from across the street who pants you in the middle of the gym all while listening to the Sweetness by Jimmy Eats World. The anger, rage, embarrassment and sadness seem really distant now. Time has a funny way of not getting rid of the pain but dulling it. You almost have forgiven them for what they did, after the rest of the house burns maybe you’ll get in touch with them and say hey we’re even now.

                Coming out seasonally in the fall/winter*  months Fade to Black by Left Hand Brewery* could have just been another attempt at an annual Russian Imperial Stout, Cigar City has their Marshall Zhukov and Hunapu, 3 Floyd’s has about as much fan fare for their Dark Lord, both of which are good beers but not worth the fan fare. All three breweries take time to celebrate the seasons ending and beginning of another year. A time to look back and relax at what’s come and gone. I prefer the experimentation of doing something different and dark than to repeating the same recipe year after year.

                 Left Hand brewery has had five years of non-repeating volumes in the Fade to Black series. Starting with a foreign stout with tasting notes of “self loathing, burnt opportunities and smoked relationships.” . Their second volume was deeper still a Smoked Baltic Porter that would make chicagoans after the great fire go “damn that’s smokey”. Spicing it up the next year with their Pepper Porter they take on the play between self flagellation and agony. Taking the darkness to a new level their Rocky Mountain Black Ale had the hop head in mind, hops abound and are only balanced by the smoked malt which fails in it’s job to balance in an amazingly awesome way. The most current version is a Black Rye Ale, departing from the over abundance I found this one to be balanced and reassured that there was light at the end of the tunnel. Not sure if it’s old age or just pessimism dying but I like the new turn.
