I went to art school in Savannah, Georgia and they’d have a huge St. Patricks’s day celebration where they’d dye the river green and all the fountains. It was an amazing time, usually filled with lots of Guinness and drinking and shirts that said “Kiss me I’m Irish” all of it was fun and a great excuse to drink, however I doubted it was very irish.

I’ve gotten the chance to go to Ireland a few times in my life, never spent much more than a casual holiday there at a time, so never more than a week or two. I did have enough time to notice that Irish isn’t the same there as it was at the Savannah St. Patricks day celebration. 
It reminds me of the beer itself, that dark black stout that we all know is apparently ruby red. I don’t buy it either but it’s Diagio’s beer and they can do with it what they want. They claim that most of the beer is sold in the UK then abroad, which I also highly doubt but can’t find the numbers to back me up on this one. I do know however they have 3 plants in Africa and only 1 in the UK. So looking at this red stout that is 
brewed mostly in Africa i can’t help but laugh at the have a guinness on St. Patricks day posters. It’s seemingly fitting since it’s just as irish as the holiday and isn’t that the best part?
