        <p>
        A caribean style IPA with very little to note about it, except that it's traiditionally hopped on the high seas while coming from Puerto Rico to Tampa. The hops that it's brewed with also keep chaning. This is a great beer to figure out the differences between hop varietals.

            <div class="simcoe">
              <h2> Simcoe</h2>
              <p> The good ol' fashion go to hop. Simcoe was released at the beginning of the new millennium and quickly found it’s niche in the craft and home-brew crowd. It adds a ton of flavor and aroma to any beer added to it. You’ll taste that “Oh this is an IPA” taste in it because it’s so prevalent. It’s that reliable car you had in high school. It stinks and there are better ones out there but damn it you love the sucker. </p>

            <div class="kohatu">
              <h2> Kohatu</h2>
              <p>A the open source version of Citra hops. It's open to the public and newer. for tasting notes see Citra hops</p>
            </div>

            <div class="calypso">
              <h2> Calypso</h2>
              <p>with a smell f pears, apples, and hippie tea, Calypso hops makeyou feel like your drinking in a coffee shop. looking around you'll notice that no one has showered, no one has ordered the premium items on the menu, and that you are far from sitting in a starbucks. It's the hop profile for "just gonna crash on your couch for a couple weeks" future roomates. 
              </p> 
            </div>

            <div class="ahtanum">
                <h2>Ahtanum</h2>
                <p>Ahtanum with smelling notes of grapefruit and earthiness and floral hints, it’s starting to smell like the guys at cigar city did a search for “grapefruit Hops” on google and just bought those hops for this beer. With a less bitter taste than the others it’s only a mid level bittering agent. It will go on in the catalogues of history of being the one that was most like the others. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="experiment">
              <h2>Experimental Hop #529</h2>    
              <p>Experimental hop 529 no it’s not the newest Lilo and Stitch disney sanctioned beer you can buy, a the newest hop variety if newest was back in Febuary of 2014. With hints of herbal tea, lemon, mint and sweet coconut it marks a departure from the other hop varieties, they all include grapefruit while this one has lemon. See what they’re doing there. </p>

      <div id="bottom">
        <p>As with any beer I’ve heard but can’t substantiate the rumor that the Puerto Rican brewery that this beer was made at is now closed. I’ve tried to dig up “facts” to prove this journalistic reporting of news but I decided to be lazy and just report it anyways. This is the internet and what’s it without some controversy. If someone does find an official statement one way or the other let me know via my twitter or other avenue of internet and I’ll update this bottom part.</p>
