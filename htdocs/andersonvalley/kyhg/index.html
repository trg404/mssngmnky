Fresh off the boat, fresh air and fresh train to catch, passing mountains, plains, prairie and mountains again, seeing what all this new place has to offer and finally seeing your new home. Trees taller than anything you’ve ever seen, air fresher than even off the boat, and a sweetness you can’t put a finger on. You fall into your new town greeted with stares, unease, and a sense of destitute. You ask for a room only to be told “speak the language or go back home”. You look for a job only to be told “We don’t need your kind stealing our jobs”. You look desperately for some sense of belonging only to find no one is that interested. Sour’d on your position and a growing amount of salt in your soul you’ve become the towns scape goat. You perceiver and lay down roots have a son and teach him your religion. The Kimmie, the Yink and Your holy Gose. </p>

Harkening back to a better time, come regale your taste buds with this re-introduction to Gose (go-zuh) style beer. Anderson Valley Brewing Company is giving you an easy introduction to what will become one of your favorite new, old styles of beer. A traditional sour ale brewed with a surprisingly salty taste, this stop on the Highway 128 series only comes around seasonally. Don’t let the world make a sinner out of you not giving this beer a try.
