 During the month of May outside seating in Orlando is akin to outside seating in Chicago during January. It’s horrible and no one in their right mind would do it but it’s still an option for some reason. Unlike Chicago where you'll be huddling up in a corner by a space heater you’re sprawled out taking the most of the shade as you can and drinking anything that is cold. The <strong>Anderson Valley Brewing Company's Summer Solstice</strong> comes in a can that is as cool and refreshing as an ice cube falling down your shorts and has a hint of orange cream that will send you back in time to better memories than sitting in that god forsaken heat.

You snap to just in time to hear your girlfriend order a duck paté terrine with foie gras chips on the side. The heat  doesn’t seem as bad and the beer is actually pretty damn good. Now just to get the girlfriend to stop ordering this gourmet crap.

You sit in the sweltering heat under the shade of an umbrella at a fancy new restaurant your girlfriend dragged you to. After continually repeating to the server you don’t give a crap about craft beer just get you something good he comes back with the coldest thing he can find. You pop the top of a can of <strong>Summer Solstice</strong> and take a long drag. Suddenly you taste a creamy goodness that instantly transports you  back to your 13th summer in the front lawn pushing the heaviest mower man has ever made. You’re dad sits on the porch beer in hand claiming that this will build character and all you can think is <i>"Who the hell wants character if this is how it’s built?"</i> You’ve never been so thirsty in your life as you’re finally done with the front lawn you go to sit by your dad who opens the cooler and hands you a cream soda. It’s the best tasting thing you’ve ever had quenching not only your thirst but the hatred you just felt for your dad melts away. </p>
