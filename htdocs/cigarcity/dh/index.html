  <div class="col-xs-6"><p>
A caribean style IPA with very little to note about it, except that it's traiditionally hopped on the high seas while coming from Puerto Rico to Tampa. The hops that it's brewed with also keep chaning. This is a great beer to figure out the differences between hop varietals. </p>

              <h1>Citra</h1>
<p>A “fruity hop” that is as fruity as a pine cone. It’s supposed to add “tropical fruit” aroma’s to the beer, but this usually comes out as grapefruit. It’s a solid tasting pinecone as far as hops go. The fact that it’s a mainstay of the beers in the south east it’s becoming a key contributor for me to understand where the beer comes from. it’ll be interesting to see if this continues. </p>

             <p> The good ol' fashion go to hop. Simcoe was released at the beginning of the new millennium and quickly found it’s niche in the craft and home-brew crowd. It adds a ton of flavor and aroma to any beer added to it. You’ll taste that “Oh this is an IPA” taste in it because it’s so prevalent. It’s that reliable car you had in high school. It stinks and there are better ones out there but damn it you love the sucker. </p>

<p>Ahtanum with smelling notes of grapefruit and earthiness and floral hints, it’s starting to smell like the guys at cigar city did a search for “grapefruit Hops” on google and just bought those hops for this beer. With a less bitter taste than the others it’s only a mid level bittering agent. It will go on in the catalogues of history of being the one that was most like the others. </p>

With hints of herbal tea, lemon, mint and sweet coconut it marks a departure from the other hop varieties, they all include grapefruit while this one has lemon. See what they’re doing there. </p>

As with any beer I’ve heard but can’t substantiate the rumor that the Puerto Rican brewery that this beer was made at is now closed. I’ve tried to dig up “facts” to prove this journalistic reporting of news but I decided to be lazy and just report it anyways. This is the internet and what’s it without some controversy. If someone does find an official statement one way or the other let me know via my twitter or other avenue of internet and I’ll update this bottom part.</p> </div>
