A lot can happen in 60 minutes. Dogfish Head has taken that time to continually hop their flagship IPA. They add hops 60 times over a 60 minute boil. This creates a bitter but complex flavor. For reference Miller once advertised they hop their beers 3 times, try both and you can see where the extra 20X hoping comes in.

Man can never leave well enough alone, we need to divide things up and categorize them. Each year is made up of 365 days, each day 24 hours each hour 60 minutes, each minute 60 seconds. That means on average our heart beats 2400 times a day, if you have an average heart rate of 100 beats per minute. So in the 6000 beats it took to brew a glass of this IPA what are you going to do with them? Not like you can get any of them back.
