            Sitting on the front porch as the sun sets* you think back to your early days, your highschool days, your prom date from across the street who pants you in the middle of the gym all while listening to the Sweetness by Jimmy Eats World. The anger, rage, embarrassment and sadness seem really distant now. Time has a funny way of not getting rid of the pain but dulling it. You almost have forgiven them for what they did, after the rest of the house burns maybe you’ll get in touch with them and say hey we’re even now.
