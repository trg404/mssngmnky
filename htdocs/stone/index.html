<p>You walk up to the door with your lady, to end what was one of the more awkward first dates of your life. She stands there with the flowers you got her in hand silently waiting for the night to be over. You say something and lean in for a kiss. BAM! Instead of her lips youâ€™re greeted with a fist. That right hook came out from behind the flowers and got you right in the mouth flower petals and all. Your head hanging low, the shock of what just happened, a bitter outlook towards women, and the faint taste of flowers in your mouth you head back to your car. You sir have just experienced Stone IPA. </p>
